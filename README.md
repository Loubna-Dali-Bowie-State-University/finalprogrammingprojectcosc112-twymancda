**Java Course Project Assignment: Instructions and Guidelines**

In this course project, your team will design and implement a Java application based on one of the following topics:

- **Expense Tracker Application**: Develop an application that allows users to record, track, and categorize expenses. Key features include adding new expenses, viewing summaries, and setting budget limits.

- **Library Management System**: Create a system to manage a library’s catalog, member database, and book borrowing/returning processes. Features should cover member registration, book searches, loan tracking, and overdue notifications.

- **Inventory System for a Retail Store**: Design an inventory management system to track product stock levels, sales, and supplier orders. The app should allow for adding/updating products, generating low-stock alerts, and producing sales reports.

- **Employee Attendance and Payroll System**: Implement a system to track employee attendance and calculate payroll. Key features include employee check-in/check-out, working hours calculation, salary computation, and report generation.

**Project Requirements**

- **Team Selection**: Each team should consist of 2–3 members. Choose team members with complementary skills and a shared work ethic.

- **Topic Selection**: 
  - Select one of the four project topics as a team.
  - A survey will be conducted in class to register each team’s chosen topic.
  - Topics are assigned on a first-come, first-served basis. If your chosen topic reaches capacity, you’ll need to select an alternative.

**Survey Guidelines**

- **Timing**: Be ready to submit your team’s topic choice as soon as the survey is released in class.
- **Alternative Choices**: Since topic slots are limited, discuss and agree on a backup option with your team beforehand.

**Project Deliverables**

- **Project Proposal**: Submit a brief proposal that includes your chosen topic, team members, and a high-level overview of the application’s core features and functionality. **Due one week after topics are assigned.**

- **Mid-Project Check-in**: Halfway through the project timeline, submit a progress report covering the current state of your application, any challenges encountered, and a completion timeline.

- **Final Submission**: 
  - Submit your completed application, accompanied by a brief user manual.
  - Each team will also present their application in class on the project deadline.

**Evaluation Criteria**

Your project will be evaluated based on:
- Functionality: How well the application meets the project requirements.
- User Interface: Usability and design quality of the application’s interface.
- Code Quality: Clarity, organization, and adherence to best coding practices.
- Team Collaboration: Evidence of effective teamwork and equitable contribution.
- Presentation: Clarity and professionalism of the in-class presentation.

Make sure to adhere to these guidelines to ensure a successful project experience!
